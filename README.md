```

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (EKS, Minikube, or any K8s setup)
- kubectl installed and configured
- Helm installed 
- Access to the necessary container images and repositories

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

#### 1.Apply the Helm Chart

created, install the Helm chart (citrin-os):

for Dev
```
helm install dev-citrinos ./citrin-os --values ./citrin-os/values-dev.yaml
```

for Prod

```
helm install prod-citrinos ./citrin-os --values ./citrin-os/values-prod.yaml
```
Confirm that the deployment is running successfully:

```
helm list
kubectl get pods -n citrin-os
```

you can upgrade the values and to reflect the changes run the following command accordingly

```
helm upgrade <HELM_NAME> ./citrin-os --values ./citrin-os/values-<dev-prod>.yaml 
```

#### 2. Updating the Deployment
If any changes are made in values-dev.yaml or values-prod.yaml
To upgrade the Helm release with new configurations:

```
helm upgrade citrin-os ./citrin-os
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup the Deployment
#### To remove the Helm release:

```
helm uninstall <HELM-CHART-NAME>
```

# üìå Notes
- Deploy the Helm chart (citrin-os/) afterward to ensure dependent services are available. At intial stages Citirus , Diritus pod may go backoff because the DB and rabbitmq may take more time to get ready to run
